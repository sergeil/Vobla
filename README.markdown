What is Vobla ?
--
Vobla is a fully-fledged Dependency Injection container that sits on top of PHP5.3+. It has
very powerful and yet very extensible architecture that is based on composition idea rather than
inheritance counterpart. In Vobla you have three ways to define your services:

 - Annotations
 - XML
 - Plain PHP

The most important thing about Vobla is that its architecture was designed according to the real
word requirements and new features are added whenever there's a need - in other words, Vobla's
architecture and the source code is not bloated with questionable features implementations.
